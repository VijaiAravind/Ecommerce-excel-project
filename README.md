---
# Projects Description
This two projects of excel involves analyzing the sales data of an Shoppr e-commerce store and coffee sales data to extract valuable insights, such as customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The analysis includes visualizations and key metrics that help in decision-making, such as sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and inventory optimization.

The goal is to demonstrate how data analysis techniques in Excel, such as pivot tables, charts, and advanced functions, can be used to derive actionable insights from business data.

# Functions and Techniques
Excel Functions: SUMIF, VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, etc.
Pivot Tables: For summarizing sales, products, and customer data.
